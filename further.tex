  \frametitle{Further Suggestions \& Plans}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Train more and more, and more!
    \item Change hyperparameters and the reward function.
    \item When sampling from $f_i^{-1}(f_i(g))$, we may use trainable sampler to make it learn the distribution of possible games from the given observation. This may make the sampling process more stable.
    \item Use ISMCTS or $\alpha\mu$ search to handle incomplete information.
    PIMC has been criticized due to its critical problems: strategy fusion and non-locality. By using other algorithms to handle hidden information, we may get a better result.
    \item Or use different architecture like ReBeL to handle imperfect information better.
  \end{itemize}
